# What to solve?
Web3 version of stackoverflow.<br>
Stackoverflow is good, but sometimes beginners want to ask questions repeatedly answered in the past. Users with such behavior, who don't search by themselves, would have bad reputation in the system and the result is such users cannot question anymore.<br>
Even if it's a repeatedly asked queries, we can incetivize respondent (in some cases, just giving the answered links might be good enough for the quetioner.)<br>
Using crypto for this scnario is good, because web3 has payment solution as its default and for users familiar with web3, it could be a casual thing to use crypto for the payment.<br>
